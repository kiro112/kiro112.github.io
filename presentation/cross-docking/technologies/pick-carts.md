# Pick Carts

_Ideal for split-case and small item applications_

Each Pick Cart is custom designed to hold multiple containers. Each container holds a different order, so operators can batch pick multiple orders on a single trip through the warehouse.


- Voice Directed Pick Carts:
The voice headset uses audible commands to prompt the operator how many products to “put” in each container. The operator then verbally confirms the correct location. 

- Light Directed Pick Cart:
A display on the Pick Cart directs the operator to picking locations in a logical sequence. The operator confirms the correct location using an onboard scanner. Light directed slot displays on the cart show how many products to “put” in each container. 

To confirm the picks for each container, the operator presses a button on the slot display.
