# Pick-to-Light, Put-to-Light

Easily visible lights located directly on the storage slot indicate where the next item is to be picked, and a display signals the number of items to be retrieved.

After retrieval, the order picker acknowledges the process by pressing a button, and the display switches off. All information is exchanged in real time with the master materials management or warehouse management system.

### Pick-to-Light Systems 

_Light displays direct operators to specific stock locations_

use light displays to direct operators to specific stock locations. Each product location can have an individual numeric or alphanumeric display with a light, an acknowledgement button, and a digital readout for indicating quantity. Other configurations allow fewer or more simplified displays to reduce the total cost.

In a typical Pick-by-Light system, the picking sequence starts at the beginning of a zone where the operator scans a bar coded address label attached to the shipping carton or tote. The display tells the operator which products to pick and how many of each. The operator confirms picks via acknowledgement buttons.


### Put-to-Light Systems 

_Light displays guide the operator to put stock in an order_

light displays instruct the operator where and how to allocate stock to orders, allowing efficient picking from bulk stock. The operator scans each product and flashing light displays at each location indicate which containers require that product and how many items to put. Confirmed put results are updated to the system in real time for host system updates.

Typical businesses using a put system include retailers of general merchandise, apparel, grocery, convenience foods, sporting goods, and personal care items.
