# Unsorted/Labeled Crossdocking

In this strategy, the vendor labeled all inbound merchandise with an outbound label. When the customer received the merchandise, it has already been identified. The customer can put the goods in a conveyor system and let the conveyor system sort the product. If the product is not placed on a conveyor, the product is directed to the staging location and is manually place in that staging location. The customer is providing the other consolidation of this inbound merchandise with the other merchandise that is awaiting shipment.
