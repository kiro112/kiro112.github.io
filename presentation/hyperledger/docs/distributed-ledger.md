# Distributed Ledger

### What is disributed ledger ?
A distributed ledger (also called shared ledger) is a consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. There is no central administrator or centralised data storage.

A peer-to-peer network is required as well as consensus algorithms to ensure replication across nodes is undertaken.[2] One distributed ledger design is through implementation of a public or private blockchain system.
