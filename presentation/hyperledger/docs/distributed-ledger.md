# Sawtooth Ledger

Distributed ledgers are shared databases with the unique feature that they do not rely on a central authority or intermediary. Instead of a single, centralized database, each participant operates a copy of the database, verifies transactions, and engages in a protocol that ensures universal agreement on the state of the ledger.

A distributed ledger (also called shared ledger) is a consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. There is no central administrator or centralised data storage.
