# What is Hyperledger Sawtooth ?

Hyperledger Sawtooth is a modular platform for building, deploying, and running distributed ledgers. Distributed ledgers provide a digital record (such as asset ownership) that is maintained without a central authority or implementation.

### Distributed Ledger

#### What is disributed ledger ?
A distributed ledger (also called shared ledger) is a consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. There is no central administrator or centralised data storage.

A peer-to-peer network is required as well as consensus algorithms to ensure replication across nodes is undertaken.[2] One distributed ledger design is through implementation of a public or private blockchain system.
